collecting the configuration files for my rat rig v-core 3 


I recently started building a Rat Rig V-Core 3 (300mm^3) and noticed that a lot of configuration boards are incomplete due to current offerings, or obsolete due to changes in RepRapFirmware.  So as I was building my VC3, I decided to make a concerted effort to document as much as the configuration as possible.  Doing that for my setup would allow others to get a head start when they started work on theirs.

Plan on finding:

config.g ✔️

bed.g ✖️

homex.g ✖️

homey.g ✖️

homez.g ✖️

homeall.g ✖️

pause.g ✖️

resume.g ✖️

and basic filament gcode, since you'll need those as well for filament loading and unloading

The end goal is a configuration bundle for a working printer that others will be able to use.
