# vcore3-duet
collecting the configuration files for my rat rig v-core 3 


I recently started building a Rat Rig V-Core 3 (300mm^3) and noticed that a lot of configuration boards are incomplete due to current offerings, or obsolete due to changes in RepRapFirmware.  So as I was building my VC3, I decided to make a concerted effort to document as much as the configuration as possible.  Doing that for my setup would allow others to get a head start when they started work on theirs.
