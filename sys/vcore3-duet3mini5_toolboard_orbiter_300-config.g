; duet toolboard 1lc
; paneldue 7i
; ldo orbiter v2.0

; dragon high-flow hotend

; LIS3DH - planned, config forthcoming. I know the toolboard 1lc but the toolboard
;  mount I'm using isn't the sturdiest and I was interested in comparing the results 
; Neopixel RGB LED strip - also planned; not configured here
;  intention is to use LEDs to indicate heating/ready/cooling status, along with illumination for webcam
